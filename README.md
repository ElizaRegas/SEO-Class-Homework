## Description 

This is the first homework assignment for the Georgia Tech Full Stack Flex Program. We've been asked to refactor a website to improve accessibility, optimize search results, and generally clean up the code.

During this assignment, we've had the opportunity to familiarize ourselves with semantic elements which set the structure for compliance with accessibility requirements. We've explored title information and meta tags to target bettter search engine results. We've also tried to consolidate repetitive code to make it as dry as possible.

## Installation

Clone the repository, and run the index.html file in browser.

## Usage 

This simple HTML file uses best practices for accessibility in programming.
